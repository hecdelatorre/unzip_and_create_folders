# Unzip and Create Folders Script

## Description

This bash script automates the process of unzipping files and creating folders based on the zip file names. It prompts the user to enter the path where the zip files are located, validates the directory's existence, and then proceeds to decompress each zip file into a corresponding folder within that directory.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script `unzip_and_create_folders.sh`.
2. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to execute the script (`chmod +x unzip_and_create_folders.sh`).
3. Run the script by executing `./unzip_and_create_folders.sh`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the path where the zip files are located.
5. The script will then unzip each zip file into a folder with the same name as the zip file.
